name: epic-to-feature-specs
description: Break a large epic doc into implementation-ready feature specs that sit between epic-level goals and story-level detail. Use whenever the user says "break down epic", "split epic", "decompose epic", "write feature specs", "epic → spec", "epic to stories", "make this epic AI-codeable", "spec out this epic", Vietnamese equivalents ("chia epic", "viết spec", "tách epic thành spec"), or complains that stories are too small and epics are too big for AI coding agents. Also trigger when the user uploads an epic doc and asks how to hand it to engineering, or when discussing FE/BE handoff contracts, team-split implementation planning, or SMART decomposition. Adapts to different user personas — non-tech PMs delegating to engineering teams get guided FE/BE splits with handoff contracts, while technical users get flexible splitting options (by service, domain, layer, or custom). Optionally integrates UI designs from Figma or Pencil to ensure FE specs match design system components and screen flows. Produce a small number (default 3, up to 5) of feature specs per epic, each with a TypeScript handoff contract and acceptance criteria — the output is designed to be fed directly to AI coding agents so teams can ship in parallel.

# Epic → Feature Specs

## What this skill does

Transforms an epic document (a phase-sized goal with many user stories) into **3-5 feature specs** — an intermediate layer between epic and story that is sized for AI coding agents and team-parallel implementation.

The core problem this solves: epics are too big (agent loses the thread, scope creeps, technical decisions drift) and stories are too small (agent implements in isolation, misses shared code paths, re-litigates decisions). A feature spec bundles stories that share an implementation boundary, freezes the technical contracts, and preserves just enough context for a bounded agent session.

## Core principles

**1. Each spec must be SMART-independent.** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound — and crucially, **measurable without its siblings existing**. If Spec B needs Spec A done before B can be tested, the cut is wrong. Use mocked contracts so every spec is independently verifiable.

**2. The handoff contract is load-bearing.** When teams are split (e.g. FE/BE), the contract is what lets them work in parallel. It must be typed (TypeScript or equivalent), frozen before either side codes, and canonical in one place that AI agents can read.

**3. Decisions already made stay made.** Feature specs carry a "Decisions Already Made" section so agents don't re-argue provider choices, state libraries, or data layer picks. This is the single biggest reason agents drift mid-implementation.

**4. Max 5 specs per epic.** 3 is default. 5 is the ceiling. More fragmentation than 5 is a signal the epic itself should be split.

**5. Adapt to the user, not the other way around.** Different users need different splitting strategies. A non-tech PM delegating to an FE/BE team needs clear ownership boundaries and handoff contracts. A technical lead breaking down their own work needs flexible cuts by service, domain, or value slice. The skill detects which persona is at play and adjusts accordingly.

**6. FE specs must be grounded in designs when available.** If UI designs exist (Figma, Pencil, or other tools), the FE spec must reference them — mapping screens to components, citing design tokens, and linking acceptance criteria to specific design states. This prevents the "technically correct but doesn't match the design" failure mode.

## Workflow

Follow these steps in order. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to gather inputs — do not assume.

### Step 1: Understand the user (persona detection)

Before asking about team structure or technical details, determine who you're working with. This shapes everything downstream — the questions you ask, the cutting strategy, and the level of technical detail in the specs.

Ask the user (use AskUserQuestion):

1. **Your role in this epic** — present options:
   - **PM / non-technical owner** — "I write the epic, another team implements it. I need specs that clearly divide work across my FE/BE (or other) teams with handoff contracts."
   - **Technical lead / architect** — "I understand the codebase. I want help decomposing this epic into implementation-ready specs for myself or my team. I'll decide how to split."
   - **Solo developer / full-stack** — "I'm implementing this myself. I want specs to break the work into manageable AI-codeable chunks."

Store the persona. It determines:

| Persona | Default team split | Contract depth | Design integration | Technical detail level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PM / non-technical | FE + BE (guided) | Full handoff contracts with prose companion | High — map designs to specs | Business-facing acceptance criteria |
| Technical lead | User-defined (flexible) | Typed interfaces only (skip prose companion unless requested) | Medium — reference designs, user extracts details | Implementation-level acceptance criteria |
| Solo developer | Single team (no split) | Internal seams only | Light — link to designs | Full technical detail, code-level notes |

### Step 2: Gather context

Now ask the remaining context questions, **adapted to the persona**:

**For all personas:**

1. **Epic source** — path to the epic file, or Notion URL. Read it in full before proceeding.
2. **Max spec count** — 3 (default, tightest) / 4 / 5 (ceiling).
3. **Spec storage location** — where to write the `.md` files (e.g. `product_docs/specs/{epic}/`, `.hoangsa/sessions/{branch}/`, `docs/specs/`).
4. **Existing tech doc** — ask if there's an architecture/technical document the specs should cite rather than duplicate. Read it if provided.

**For PM / non-technical persona — add:**

5. **Team structure** — present options:
   - FE + BE (presentation vs. everything-else — **recommended default**)
   - FE + BE + Mobile (three-way)
   - Other (free text — describe your teams)

   Explain: "FE team gets one spec per epic covering all presentation work. BE team gets the remaining specs split by service or pipeline stage. A typed handoff contract connects them."

6. **Contract storage location** — where TypeScript contract files live (e.g. `contracts/` at repo root).
7. **Language for the contract** — default TypeScript. Offer alternatives only if the user's stack clearly isn't TS.

**For Technical lead persona — add:**

5. **How do you want to split?** — present options:
   - By team boundary (FE/BE, FE/BE/Mobile, etc.) — same as PM flow
   - By service or domain (e.g. "auth service", "payment pipeline", "notification system")
   - By implementation layer (UI / domain logic / data layer)
   - By value slice (happy path first, then resilience, then polish)
   - Custom — describe your preferred split

   If they pick "by team boundary", follow the PM flow for team structure questions. Otherwise, ask them to describe the boundaries they want.

6. **Contract format** — TypeScript interfaces (default), Go types, Python protocols, JSON Schema, or "just markdown descriptions".

**For Solo developer persona — add:**

5. **Preferred split approach** — present options:
   - By value slice (ship incrementally — **recommended**)
   - By layer (UI / domain / data)
   - By feature area (group related stories)
   - Let the skill decide based on the epic

6. **Do you want typed contracts between specs?** — Yes (helps AI agents stay bounded) / No (lightweight, just markdown boundaries).

Do not improvise these inputs. A wrong assumption here corrupts every spec downstream.

### Step 2.5: Gather UI design references

After gathering context, check for available UI designs. This step is critical for any epic that has user-facing features.

**Auto-detect design tools:** Before asking the user, check which design MCPs are available:
- Look for Figma MCP tools (e.g. `mcp__figma__*` or `mcp__e8eed802-*` / `mcp__plugin_design_figma__*`)
- Look for Pencil MCP tools (e.g. `mcp__pencil__*`)

**If design MCP(s) are detected**, ask:

> "I can see you have {Figma/Pencil} connected. Do you have UI designs for this epic I should reference? If so, please share the file URL or key, and I'll pull component details, screen flows, and design tokens directly into the FE spec."

**If no design MCP is detected**, ask:

> "Do you have UI designs for this epic (Figma, Pencil, screenshots, or any other format)? Providing designs helps ensure the FE spec matches your intended UI — I can map screens to components and reference specific design states in acceptance criteria."

Present options:
- **Yes — Figma** (provide file URL or key)
- **Yes — Pencil** (provide document ID)
- **Yes — other format** (screenshots, PDF, or URL)
- **No designs yet** (skip — specs will note "UI design TBD" where relevant)

**When designs are provided, extract the following:**

If a **Figma MCP** is available and the user provides a Figma URL/key:
1. Use `get_file` or `get_file_nodes` to retrieve the page/frame structure
2. Use `get_file_components` to list reusable components used in the designs
3. Use `get_file_styles` to extract design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
4. Use `get_image` to capture screenshots of key screens for reference
5. Use `get_screenshot` (Dev Mode MCP) if available for higher-fidelity captures

If a **Pencil MCP** is available:
1. Use `open_document` and `get_editor_state` to understand the document structure
2. Use `get_screenshot` to capture key screens
3. Use `get_variables` to extract design tokens
4. Use `search_all_unique_properties` to identify component patterns
5. Use `get_guidelines` to pull design system rules

If **screenshots or other static assets** are provided:
1. Read the image files to understand the UI
2. Identify screens, components, states, and flows from the visuals
3. Note any ambiguities that need designer clarification

Store the extracted design context for use in Step 4 (drafting specs).

### Step 3: Read and analyze the epic

Read the epic file. Identify:

- The **goal** (the one-sentence outcome)
- The **user stories** (enumerate them with their IDs)
- **Dependencies** on other epics or external systems
- **Technical notes** (stack decisions, architectural constraints)
- **Out-of-scope** items (these must NOT bleed into any spec)

Then mentally group the stories by **implementation cohesion** — which stories touch the same files, the same service, the same state machine? Groupings become candidate specs.

**If UI designs were provided in Step 2.5**, also identify:
- Which user stories have corresponding screens/frames in the design
- Which stories share UI components (candidates for the same spec)
- Any design states (loading, error, empty, success) that imply acceptance criteria not written in the epic
- Gaps: stories with no design coverage, or designs with no matching story

**When mismatches are found, do NOT silently resolve them.** Use AskUserQuestion to surface each mismatch (or batch related mismatches) with a concrete recommendation so the user can decide quickly. For each mismatch, present:

1. **What the mismatch is** — be specific (e.g. "The design has a 'Settings' screen but no user story covers settings in this epic")
2. **Why it matters** — what breaks if we ignore it (e.g. "FE will build a screen with no acceptance criteria, or skip a screen the designer intended")
3. **Recommended action** — one of:
   - *Add a story to cover the design* (if it fits this epic's scope)
   - *Defer the design screen to a future epic* (if it's out of scope)
   - *Request a design for the uncovered story* (if the story is in scope but has no design)
   - *Escalate to PM + designer to resolve the contradiction* (if design and story disagree)
   - *Proceed without design for this story* (if the UI is trivial or backend-only)
4. **Alternative options** — so the user isn't locked into one path

Record all mismatch resolutions in Section 5.5 of the feature spec template. **Unresolved mismatches block the spec from reaching "Frozen" status.**

### Step 4: Pick a cutting strategy

See `references/cutting-strategies.md` for the full decision tree. The strategy depends on the persona detected in Step 1:

**PM / non-technical persona:**
- Default to **Dual-team** → Spec X.1 is always the FE spec (all presentation work for the epic). BE specs split by service or by stage. This is the most common and safest pattern for delegated teams.
- FE (or any presentation-only team) gets exactly one spec per epic. All of that team's work rolls up into Spec X.1. One doc per epic for that team — this simplifies their reading and keeps cognitive load low.

**Technical lead persona:**
- Follow the split approach they chose in Step 2. If they picked "by team boundary", use the Dual-team pattern. Otherwise, use the matching strategy from `references/cutting-strategies.md`.
- Do not force Spec X.1 = FE if they chose a different split. Respect their architecture judgment.

**Solo developer persona:**
- Default to **Vertical-by-value-slice** (ship incrementally). Spec X.1 = happy-path end-to-end, X.2 = error handling + resilience, X.3 = polish + edge cases.
- If they chose "by layer", use Horizontal-by-layer.
- Contracts between specs are optional but recommended as internal seams for AI agents.

If uncertain, ask the user rather than guessing. The wrong cut is the most expensive mistake this skill can make.

### Step 5: Draft the specs

Use `templates/feature-spec.md` as the starting structure. Fill each spec with:

- Linkage back to the epic (cite goal and story IDs from the original)
- Scope in/out (explicit; no overlap with sibling specs)
- SMART outcome (see `references/smart-checklist.md`)
- Dependencies (on sibling specs and external epics)
- **Handoff Contract** (most important section for multi-team setups — see below)
- Grouped user stories with acceptance criteria
- Decisions Already Made (cite the tech doc; don't re-argue)
- Test plan (how we verify independently)
- Out of Scope Within This Spec (prevents gold-plating)
- **UI Design Reference** (if designs were provided — see section below)

#### UI Design Reference in specs

If UI designs were gathered in Step 2.5, every spec that includes user-facing work MUST include a "UI Design Reference" section (see `templates/feature-spec.md` Section 5). This section contains:

1. **Screen-to-story mapping** — a table linking each screen/frame from the design to the user stories it covers in this spec. Include the design frame name/ID and a brief description.

2. **Component inventory** — list every design system component used in this spec's screens. For each component, note:
   - Component name (as it appears in the design tool)
   - Variants/states used (e.g. `Button/Primary/Disabled`, `Card/Expanded`)
   - Whether it already exists in the codebase or needs to be built
   - Props/configuration visible from the design

3. **Design tokens referenced** — colors, typography, spacing values from the design that the spec's UI must use. Extracted from the design tool's styles/variables.

4. **State-to-screen mapping** — for each state in the handoff contract (or domain logic), which design screen/variant shows that state. This is critical for FE acceptance criteria:
   - `idle` → "Inbox/Default" frame
   - `processing` → "Inbox/Processing" frame (shows spinner)
   - `failed` → "Inbox/Error" frame (shows retry button)
   - `complete` → redirects to "Library/NoteDetail" frame

5. **Design gaps and open questions** — screens or states that have no design coverage yet, or designs that are ambiguous. Each gap gets an owner and deadline.

For **PM / non-technical persona**: this section is especially important — it's the bridge between "what the designer intended" and "what the developer builds". Include screenshot references or frame links wherever possible.

For **Technical lead persona**: focus on the component inventory and state mapping. They'll extract implementation details themselves.

For **Solo developer persona**: include design links and a lightweight component list. Skip the detailed token extraction unless they request it.

### Step 6: Author the handoff contract

**Skip this step if the user is a solo developer who opted out of typed contracts.**

For each spec that crosses a team boundary (or an internal seam the user wants enforced), produce a TypeScript contract file using `templates/handoff-contract.ts`. The contract defines:

- Mutations (actions the presentation layer calls)
- Selectors / hooks (state the presentation layer reads)
- Types (discriminated unions for state machines — always prefer these over loose `status: string` fields; they force exhaustive rendering)
- Events (optional subscriptions)

**Critical rule:** the contract is coarser than the internal state it represents. If BE has internal stages (e.g. `whisper-running`, `structuring`, `dlq-retry`), those should collapse to a single `processing` state at the contract boundary. The contract is a *seam*, not a mirror.

**For PM / non-technical persona:** Also produce a prose `BE-HANDOFF.md` (see `templates/be-handoff-narrative.md`) that documents the contract in human-readable form for Notion review. The `.ts` file is canonical; the `.md` is explanation.

**For Technical lead persona:** Skip the prose companion unless explicitly requested. They can read the `.ts` file directly.

### Step 7: Validate independence (SMART check)

For each spec, run through `references/smart-checklist.md`. The most important test:

> *"Can this spec's acceptance criteria be verified with sibling specs mocked out?"*

If no, cut differently. Typical fixes:
- Merge two specs that have circular dependencies
- Extract the shared dependency into a new spec that both depend on (counts toward the 5-spec ceiling)
- Move scope out (it belongs to another epic)

**Additional validation when designs are present:**
- Every screen in the design is covered by exactly one spec (no orphan screens)
- Every design state (loading, error, empty, success) has a matching acceptance criterion
- The component inventory doesn't have components split across specs without a clear owner

### Step 8: Write files and produce a dependency graph

Write each spec to the agreed storage path using the naming convention:

```
spec-{epic-number}.{spec-number}-{team}-{short-title}.md
```

Examples:
- `spec-3.1-fe-processing-surface.md`
- `spec-3.2-be-upload-transcription.md`
- `spec-3.3-be-structuring-note-creation.md`

**For non-team-boundary splits** (technical lead or solo developer who split by service/layer/slice), adapt the naming:
- `spec-3.1-api-auth-endpoints.md`
- `spec-3.2-worker-transcription-pipeline.md`
- `spec-3.1-slice-happy-path.md`

Write contract files to the agreed contracts path:

```
contracts/{feature-area}.ts
```

Example: `contracts/processing.ts`

Also produce a short mermaid diagram showing spec → spec dependencies, so the team can see the ordering at a glance. Include it in the epic's existing `.md` file as an appendix or in a new `SPECS-OVERVIEW.md` in the spec folder.

### Step 9: Present results

Output to the user, adapted to their persona:

**For PM / non-technical persona:**
- List of files written (with paths)
- The dependency graph (mermaid block)
- A **"What each team reads first"** summary — e.g. "FE team starts with Spec 3.1. BE team starts with Spec 3.2 and 3.3 in parallel."
- Design coverage summary — which screens are covered, any gaps flagged
- Any open questions or places where the user should review before finalizing

**For Technical lead persona:**
- List of files written (with paths)
- The dependency graph (mermaid block)
- Contract surface summary (types and interfaces defined)
- Implementation ordering recommendation
- Open questions

**For Solo developer persona:**
- List of files written (with paths)
- The dependency graph (mermaid block)
- Suggested implementation order (which spec to start with)
- Open questions

## Handoff contract: the discipline

When a spec crosses a team boundary, follow these rules to prevent drift (the #1 failure mode of parallel teams):

1. **Freeze before coding.** The contract must be agreed by both team leads before either side writes production code. AI agents can work against mocks only if the mock shape is trustworthy.
2. **One source of truth.** The `.ts` contract file lives in one repo (the BE-owning repo is a good default). Other repos either import it as a package, sync via a small script, or copy-paste with a CI diff check. Do not rely on memory or Notion alone — AI agents need a file they can read.
3. **Amendments require co-review.** If a contract needs to change mid-implementation, both team leads sign off in the same PR. Amending quietly in one repo is the failure mode.
4. **Contract is coarser than internals.** FE sees `processing`, BE knows whether it's in Whisper-stage or DLQ-retry. Leaking internal states into the contract couples the teams and defeats the purpose.

See `references/team-split-patterns.md` for variants: FE/BE, FE/BE/Mobile, single team with service boundaries, solo developer, etc.

**Note:** For solo developers and single-team setups, the contract discipline is lighter — contracts serve as internal seams for AI agents rather than team coordination tools. The "freeze before coding" and "co-review" rules don't apply, but "one source of truth" and "coarser than internals" still help agents stay bounded.

## Anti-patterns to watch for

- **Spec 3.1 referenced in Spec 3.2's acceptance criteria** — that's a dependency cycle. Cut differently.
- **A spec with no handoff contract** — only OK for a spec that lives entirely within one team's ownership (e.g. a pure-backend worker) or for solo developers who opted out. If two teams touch it, contract is mandatory.
- **Stories copy-pasted verbatim from the epic** — preserve IDs, but rewrite acceptance criteria in the spec's voice with concrete, testable conditions.
- **Duplicating tech-doc decisions in every spec** — cite, don't re-state. The tech doc is authoritative.
- **More than 5 specs per epic** — the epic itself is probably too big. Escalate to the user: "Do we want to split the epic first?"
- **FE spec that also contains BE behaviour** — FE spec is presentation + input validation only. Domain logic goes to BE specs. (Applies to dual-team splits; for other split types, boundaries are defined by the user's chosen strategy.)
- **FE spec that ignores the design** — if designs were provided, every FE acceptance criterion should trace to a design screen or state. "It works but doesn't match the design" is a spec failure.
- **Design components split across specs with no clear owner** — if two specs render the same component, one must own it (build/export) and the other must consume it. Make this explicit.

## When to stop

You're done when:
- Each spec is independently testable (SMART-independent)
- Each cross-team boundary has a TypeScript contract (or the user opted out for solo work)
- The user has reviewed the dependency graph and said "yes this ships in this order"
- Files are written to the agreed paths
- If designs were provided: every screen has a spec owner, and every spec's design section is complete

If the user wants a worked example or a single spec drafted in full detail, offer to draft Spec X.1 end-to-end (the FE-heavy one when teams are split — it's the hardest to get right, so stress-test it first).
